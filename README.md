## Project Information <br>
This project analyzed Underrepresented Minority Enrollments (UMEs) at ten Big 10  institutions over the last 20 years in the context of significant affirmative action events. 

## Methodology
1. Gather enrollment data from the [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/)
2. Calculate URM as a percent of total enrollment at each institution to allow for comparison across institutions
3. Plot significant affirmative action events and analyze UMEs in the context of those events

## Analysis
**2006:** Michigan voters passed a constitutional amendment to [ban affirmative action](https://abcnews.go.com/US/LegalCenter/story?id=2644440&page=1). UMEs noticeably declined at Michigan State and the University of Michigan in the three years after the vote. 

**2008-2011:** IPEDS updated race and ethnicity categories by adding a "two or more races" category and splitting "Asian or Pacific Islander" into two categories. Use of the new categories was optional from 2008 to 2011 and mandatory in 2011. 

Overall, there was a slight downward trend in UME enrollments during the 2008 - 2011 IPEDS category transition. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) enrollments make up a very small percentage of total enrollments (maximum of 0.14%); therefore, the new NHOPI category would not cause a significant increase in URM. However, counts in the ‘Two or more races’ category are larger (typically 2 – 3%). If students who report ‘two or more races’ after 2011 had previously reported a single URM race, the IPEDS category change could account for a downward trend in URM from 2008 – 2011.

**2014:** U.S. Supreme Court [upholds Michigan affirmative action ban](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/291/), allowing other states to impose similar bans. Arizona, California, Florida, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, and Washington had banned affrimative action by 2014. 

**2016:** Federal court [upholds University of Texas at Austin’s race-conscious admissions policy](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/579/14-981/) after U.S. Supreme Court review.

Despite the uncertain legal landscape and implementation of several statewide affirmative action bans from 2014 - 2016, URM enrollments generally increased or remained unchanged at the sample institutions. We could infer from the data that affirmative action policies and bans have not had a significant impact URM enrollments; however, it’s possible that other significant events occurring outside of our analysis impacted URM enrollments during this period.

**2023:** [U.S. Supreme Court rejects affirmative action in college admissions](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf), barring all public and private colleges from considering race in admissions decisions.
